# User stories

## Background

I work on multiple repositories on multiple git foundries (GitHub, GitLab, Gitea on own VPS).
I often switch between half-done projects and forget where I did what.

## Stories

1. I want to set up the tool with my foundry credentials, so it can discover my repos.
2. I want to fetch and browse my repos across all foundries, so I can find projects I worked on.
3. I want to track a project by name or URL, so it becomes part of my local workspace.
4. I want to untrack a project I no longer care about.
5. I want to sync tracked projects to a local directory, cloning new ones and pulling updates.
6. I want to see a list of my tracked projects at a glance.
7. I want to see a unified git history across tracked projects, so I can recall what I did and where.
8. I want to export my tracked projects to a file, so I can transfer my setup to another machine.
9. I want to import tracked projects from a file, so I can restore my workspace on a new machine.
