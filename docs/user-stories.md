# User stories

## Background

I work on multiple repositories on multiple git foundries (github, gitlab, gitea on own vps.)
I often switch between half-done projects and forget where I did what. 

## Stories

* I want a tool that can help me creating a unified history of my work, so I can quickly see which projects I was working on.
* I want a short changelog per project.
* I want to see a brief list of which projects/repos i worked on
* I want to see features/changes per project.
